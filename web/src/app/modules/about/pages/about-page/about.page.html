            IOTA
        </a>, a truly promising ecosystem of
        technologies that utilizes the IOTA Foundation's (IF) implementation of a
        <i>distributed ledger technology</i> (DLT) known as the IOTA Tangle. HelloTangle acts as a
        simple bridge between a user and the IOTA network, allowing one the ability to quickly
        and easily send messages to any given address. The frontend (what you're using now)
        is built with Angular, while the backend (where the actual message broadcasting takes place)
        was built with NestJS. To see more of the technical details, checkout the

    <p class='about__info'>
        To give some explanation about IOTA, it is a new internet protocol that is intended
        for transacting between machines that are a part of the <i>IoT</i> (Internet of Things).
        Many people know it as a cryptocurrency, which to be fair it was inspired mainly by
        that realm of technologies (i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum), but it aims to be much more than
        that in a few ways:
    </p>

    <ul class='about__info-list'>
        <li class='about__info-list-item'>
            Implementing the <i>Tangle</i> to store transactions as opposed to a blockchain data
            structure like what Bitcoin or Ethereum use (a.k.a linked lists). Because the
            Tangle is essentially a <i>directed acyclic graph</i> (DAG), the network is not
            bottlenecked by miners needing to confirm transactions like in Bitcoin, meaning
            that it offers much faster confirmation times. This means that IOTA transactions
            are <b>feeless</b> since you (or your devices) are the entities responsible for
            confirming transactions so that yours will be confirmed.

            Offering data-only transactions as well as microtransactions, which affords the
            <i>m2m</i> (machine-to-machine) <i>economy</i> a much more efficient and secure way of
            transferring value or data between devices. This also carries huge implications
            for how our data with be handled in the future as there are projects being
            developed, namely

            authenticity, confidence, and so forth.

            Aiming to be the primary network protocol used by the m2m economy while offering
            engineers a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools for interacting with the IOTA
            network. Those could be libraries for running nodes to process transactions,
            backend servers creating transactions, or handling sensitive and confidential data.

        Thanks for checking out the app. Cheers!
